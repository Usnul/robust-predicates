# robust-predicates

Fast robust predicates for computational geometry in JavaScript. A modern port of [Jonathan R Shewchuk's C code](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/robust.html), which has been an industry standard since 1996. Uses code generation to produce highly efficient JavaScript code. A work in progress:

- [x] `orient2d`
- [ ] `orient3d`
- [ ] `incircle`
- [ ] `insphere`
- [ ] benchmarks
- [ ] tests
- [ ] API docs & demo
- [ ] minified UMD builds
